Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,AssociateCreatedArtifact,POST,/associatecreatedartifact,Associates a created artifact of an AWS cloud resource, the target receiving the migration, with the migration task performed by a migration tool. This API has the following traits:   Migration tools can call the AssociateCreatedArtifact operation to indicate which AWS artifact is associated with a migration task.   The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b.   Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or DMS endpoint, etc.  ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,AssociateDiscoveredResource,POST,/associatediscoveredresource,Associates a discovered resource ID from Application Discovery Service (ADS) with a migration task.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,CreateProgressUpdateStream,POST,/createprogressupdatestream,Creates a progress update stream which is an AWS resource used for access control as well as a namespace for migration task names that is implicitly linked to your AWS account. It must uniquely identify the migration tool as it is used for all updates made by the tool; however, it does not need to be unique for each AWS account because it is scoped to the AWS account.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,DeleteProgressUpdateStream,POST,/deleteprogressupdatestream,Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API has the following traits:   The only parameter needed for DeleteProgressUpdateStream is the stream name (same as a CreateProgressUpdateStream call).   The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously be doing the actual delete of the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated resources, resource attributes, created artifacts).   If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a ListProgressUpdateStreams call.    CreateProgressUpdateStream, ImportMigrationTask, NotifyMigrationTaskState, and all Associate[*] APIs realted to the tasks belonging to the stream will throw "InvalidInputException" if the stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.   Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, CreateProgressUpdateStream for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).  ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json

Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,NotifyMigrationTaskState,POST,/notifymigrationtaskstate,Notifies Migration Hub of the current status, progress, or other detail regarding a migration task. This API has the following traits:   Migration tools will call the NotifyMigrationTaskState API to share the latest progress and status.    MigrationTaskName is used for addressing updates to the correct target.    ProgressUpdateStream is used for access control and to provide a namespace for each migration tool.  ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,AWSMigrationHub,RESOURCE,PutResourceAttributes,POST,/putresourceattributes,Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it can be associated in the Application Discovery Service (ADS)'s repository. This association occurs asynchronously after PutResourceAttributes returns.  Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first called with a MAC address, but later, it is desired to add an IP address, it will then be required to call it with both the IP and MAC addresses to prevent overiding the MAC address.   Because this is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200, whether an association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found based on the provided details, call ListAssociatedResource. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/AWSMigrationHub-2017-05-31.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,AddTagsToCertificate,POST,/addtagstocertificate,Adds one or more tags to an ACM Certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair. You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see Tagging ACM Certificates. To remove one or more tags, use the RemoveTagsFromCertificate action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the ListTagsForCertificate action.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,DeleteCertificate,POST,/deletecertificate,Deletes an ACM Certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list of ACM Certificates that can be displayed by calling the ListCertificates action or be retrieved by calling the GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be available for use by other AWS services.  You cannot delete an ACM Certificate that is being used by another AWS service. To delete a certificate that is in use, the certificate association must first be removed. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json

Currently, ACM Certificates can be used only with Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon CloudFront. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,ImportCertificate,POST,/importcertificate,Imports an SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with ACM's integrated AWS services.  ACM does not provide managed renewal for certificates that you import.  For more information about importing certificates into ACM, including the differences between certificates that you import and those that ACM provides, see Importing Certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. To import a certificate, you must provide the certificate and the matching private key. When the certificate is not self-signed, you must also provide a certificate chain. You can omit the certificate chain when importing a self-signed certificate. The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded. For more information about converting these items to PEM format, see Importing Certificates Troubleshooting in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn field. Include this field only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate. This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json

To delete a tag, use the RemoveTagsFromCertificate action.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,RemoveTagsFromCertificate,POST,/removetagsfromcertificate,Remove one or more tags from an ACM Certificate. A tag consists of a key-value pair. If you do not specify the value portion of the tag when calling this function, the tag will be removed regardless of value. If you specify a value, the tag is removed only if it is associated with the specified value. To add tags to a certificate, use the AddTagsToCertificate action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to a specific ACM Certificate, use the ListTagsForCertificate action.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,RequestCertificate,POST,/requestcertificate,Requests an ACM Certificate for use with other AWS services. To request an ACM Certificate, you must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your site. You can also specify additional FQDNs if users can reach your site by using other names. For each domain name you specify, email is sent to the domain owner to request approval to issue the certificate. After receiving approval from the domain owner, the ACM Certificate is issued. For more information, see the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,acm,RESOURCE,ResendValidationEmail,POST,/resendvalidationemail,Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM Certificate before it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website and then clicking I Approve. However, the validation email can be blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM Certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate. For more information about setting up your contact email addresses, see Configure Email for your Domain. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/acm-2015-12-08.normal.json

Amazon Web Services,batch,RESOURCE,CreateComputeEnvironment,POST,/v1/createcomputeenvironment,Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the compute resources within the environment, based on the compute resources that you specify. Instances launched into a managed compute environment use the latest Amazon ECS-optimized AMI. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances in your managed compute environment, or you can use Amazon EC2 Spot instances that only launch when the Spot bid price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price. In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources. This provides more compute resource configuration options, such as using a custom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see Container Instance AMIs in the Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide. After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it and then manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster.

Amazon Web Services,cloudformation,RESOURCE,CancelUpdateStack,POST,/cancelupdatestack,Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.  You can cancel only stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cloudformation-2010-05-15.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,cloudformation,RESOURCE,ContinueUpdateRollback,POST,/continueupdaterollback,For a specified stack that is in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, continues rolling it back to the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually  fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when AWS CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cloudformation-2010-05-15.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,cloudformation,RESOURCE,CreateChangeSet,POST,/createchangeset,Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the DescribeChangeSet action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the ExecuteChangeSet action. AWS CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cloudformation-2010-05-15.normal.json

To create a new web distribution, submit a POST request to the CloudFront API version/distribution resource. The request body must include a document with a StreamingDistributionConfig element. The response echoes the StreamingDistributionConfig element and returns other information about the RTMP distribution. To get the status of your request, use the GET StreamingDistribution API action. When the value of Enabled is true and the value of Status is Deployed, your distribution is ready. A distribution usually deploys in less than 15 minutes.

Amazon Web Services,cloudfront,RESOURCE,UpdateDistribution2017_03_25,PUT,/2017-03-25/distribution/{Id}/config,Updates the configuration for a web distribution. Perform the following steps. For information about updating a distribution using the CloudFront console, see Creating or Updating a Web Distribution Using the CloudFront Console  in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  To update a web distribution using the CloudFront API    Submit a GetDistributionConfig request to get the current configuration and an Etag header for the distribution.  If you update the distribution again, you need to get a new Etag header.    Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your GetDistributionConfig request to include the desired changes. You can't change the value of CallerReference. If you try to change this value, CloudFront returns an IllegalUpdate error.  The new configuration replaces the existing configuration; the values that you specify in an UpdateDistribution request are not merged into the existing configuration. When you add, delete, or replace values in an element that allows multiple values (for example, CNAME), you must specify all of the values that you want to appear in the updated distribution. In addition, you must update the corresponding Quantity element.    Submit an UpdateDistribution request to update the configuration for your distribution:   In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 2. The request body must include an XML document with a DistributionConfig element.   Set the value of the HTTP If-Match header to the value of the ETag header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the GetDistributionConfig request in Step 1.     Review the response to the UpdateDistribution request to confirm that the configuration was successfully updated.   Optional: Submit a GetDistribution request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of Status is Deployed.  Beginning with the 2012-05-05 version of the CloudFront API, we made substantial changes to the format of the XML document that you include in the request body when you create or update a distribution. With previous versions of the API, we discovered that it was too easy to accidentally delete one or more values for an element that accepts multiple values, for example, CNAMEs and trusted signers. Our changes for the 2012-05-05 release are intended to prevent these accidental deletions and to notify you when there's a mismatch between the number of values you say you're specifying in the Quantity element and the number of values you're actually specifying.   ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cloudfront-2017-03-25.normal.json

The default number of results returned is 10, with a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page of results.  The rate of lookup requests is limited to one per second per account. If this limit is exceeded, a throttling error occurs.   Events that occurred during the selected time range will not be available for lookup if CloudTrail logging was not enabled when the events occurred. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cloudtrail-2013-11-01.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,cloudtrail,RESOURCE,PutEventSelectors,POST,/puteventselectors,Configures an event selector for your trail. Use event selectors to specify whether you want your trail to log management and/or data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.  Example   You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.   The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations occur in your account.   CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.   The RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.   The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event but it doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.    The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown. You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail.

Amazon Web Services,cognito-idp,RESOURCE,AdminDisableProviderForUser,POST,/admindisableproviderforuser,Disables the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social) identity provider. If the user to disable is a Cognito User Pools native username + password user, they are not permitted to use their password to sign-in. If the user to disable is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser) signs in, they must create a new user account. See AdminLinkProviderForUser. This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials. The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool.  To disable a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject, with the ProviderAttributeValue being the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social identity providers. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign-in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked in the AdminLinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cognito-idp-2016-04-18.normal.json

Amazon Web Services,cognito-idp,RESOURCE,AdminLinkProviderForUser,POST,/adminlinkproviderforuser,Links an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser) to an identity from an external identity provider (SourceUser) based on a specified attribute name and value from the external identity provider. This allows you to create a link from the existing user account to an external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in, so that the federated user identity can be used to sign in as the existing user account.   For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password, this API links that user to a federated user identity, so that when the federated user identity is used, the user signs in as the existing user account.   Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that it only be used with external identity providers and provider attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.  See also AdminDisableProviderForUser. This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cognito-idp-2016-04-18.normal.json

Amazon Web Services,cognito-idp,RESOURCE,AdminResetUserPassword,POST,/adminresetuserpassword,Resets the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator. Works on any user. When a developer calls this API, the current password is invalidated, so it must be changed. If a user tries to sign in after the API is called, the app will get a PasswordResetRequiredException exception back and should direct the user down the flow to reset the password, which is the same as the forgot password flow. In addition, if the user pool has phone verification selected and a verified phone number exists for the user, or if email verification is selected and a verified email exists for the user, calling this API will also result in sending a message to the end user with the code to change their password. Requires developer credentials.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cognito-idp-2016-04-18.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,cognito-idp,RESOURCE,AdminRespondToAuthChallenge,POST,/adminrespondtoauthchallenge,Responds to an authentication challenge, as an administrator. Requires developer credentials.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/cognito-idp-2016-04-18.normal.json

You can use this action for custom Config rules and AWS managed Config rules. A custom Config rule is a rule that you develop and maintain. An AWS managed Config rule is a customizable, predefined rule that AWS Config provides. If you are adding a new custom Config rule, you must first create the AWS Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the PutConfigRule action to add the rule to AWS Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Lambda assigns to the function. Specify the ARN for the SourceIdentifier key. This key is part of the Source object, which is part of the ConfigRule object.  If you are adding an AWS managed Config rule, specify the rule's identifier for the SourceIdentifier key. To reference AWS managed Config rule identifiers, see About AWS Managed Config Rules. For any new rule that you add, specify the ConfigRuleName in the ConfigRule object. Do not specify the ConfigRuleArn or the ConfigRuleId. These values are generated by AWS Config for new rules. If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ConfigRuleName, ConfigRuleId, or ConfigRuleArn in the ConfigRule data type that you use in this request. The maximum number of rules that AWS Config supports is 50. For more information about requesting a rule limit increase, see AWS Config Limits in the AWS General Reference Guide. For more information about developing and using AWS Config rules, see Evaluating AWS Resource Configurations with AWS Config in the AWS Config Developer Guide.,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/config-2014-11-12.normal.json

Currently, you can specify only one configuration recorder per region in your account. If ConfigurationRecorder does not have the recordingGroup parameter specified, the default is to record all supported resource types. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/config-2014-11-12.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,config,RESOURCE,PutDeliveryChannel,POST,/putdeliverychannel,Creates a delivery channel object to deliver configuration information to an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon SNS topic. Before you can create a delivery channel, you must create a configuration recorder. You can use this action to change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS topic of the existing delivery channel. To change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS topic, call this action and specify the changed values for the S3 bucket and the SNS topic. If you specify a different value for either the S3 bucket or the SNS topic, this action will keep the existing value for the parameter that is not changed.  You can have only one delivery channel per region in your account. ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/config-2014-11-12.normal.json
Amazon Web Services,config,RESOURCE,PutEvaluations,POST,/putevaluations,Used by an AWS Lambda function to deliver evaluation results to AWS Config.

Amazon Web Services,config,RESOURCE,StartConfigRulesEvaluation,POST,/startconfigrulesevaluation,Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified Config rules against the last known configuration state of the resources. Use StartConfigRulesEvaluation when you want to test a rule that you updated is working as expected. StartConfigRulesEvaluation does not re-record the latest configuration state for your resources; it re-runs an evaluation against the last known state of your resources.  You can specify up to 25 Config rules per request.  An existing StartConfigRulesEvaluation call must complete for the specified rules before you can call the API again. If you chose to have AWS Config stream to an Amazon SNS topic, you will receive a ConfigRuleEvaluationStarted notification when the evaluation starts.  You don't need to call the StartConfigRulesEvaluation API to run an evaluation for a new rule. When you create a new rule, AWS Config automatically evaluates your resources against the rule.   The StartConfigRulesEvaluation API is useful if you want to run on-demand evaluations, such as the following example:   You have a custom rule that evaluates your IAM resources every 24 hours.   You update your Lambda function to add additional conditions to your rule.   Instead of waiting for the next periodic evaluation, you call the StartConfigRulesEvaluation API.   AWS Config invokes your Lambda function and evaluates your IAM resources.   Your custom rule will still run periodic evaluations every 24 hours.  ,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/config-2014-11-12.normal.json
