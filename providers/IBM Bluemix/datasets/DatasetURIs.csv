A single container in IBM Containers is similar to a container that you create in your local Docker environment. Single containers are a good way to start with IBM Containers and to learn about how containers work in the IBM Cloud and the features that IBM Containers provides. They are also recommended when you want to run simple app tests or during the development process of an app. \n\n In the Docker API there are two separate APIs to create and start a container. However in IBM Containers a container is created and started in a single API call. Therefore, this API merges parameters from the Docker API to create and start container. \n\n To create a container with IBM Containers, you must at least define the image that the container is based on.\n\n- Image: You must include the full path to the image in your private Bluemix registry in the format: `registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/<image>`."
