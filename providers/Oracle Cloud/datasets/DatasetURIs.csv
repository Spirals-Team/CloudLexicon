To get to this result, the user has several options to proceed,\ndepending on the UI: <br>\nThe user could continue typing (i.e. adding to the query input) until the\ncomplete address has been typed. <br>\nOr the user could do a Type-Click Drill Down. In this case, the user\nselects the desired output string (typical by clicking on it). In the\nlatter case, the UI should look at fields in the metadata for this\nparticular output string, and use them as filters to issue another\ncomplete request, which is shown in Request 2. (Note: The table from the\n/address/verify section shows which fields are both Input and Output\nfields.). The corresponding response is shown in Response 2. <br>\nThis process of repeated complete requests maybe be repeated until\ncertainty is reached that one output string is the desired result.

However, when you change an IP address prefix, it could cause the IP addresses currently assigned to existing instances to fall outside the specified IP network. If this happens, all traffic to and from those vNICs will be dropped.<p>If the IP address of an instance is dynamically allocated, stopping the instance orchestration and restarting it will reassign a valid IP address from the IP network to the instance.<p>However, if the IP address of an instance is static - that is, if the IP address is specified in the instance orchestration while creating the instance - then the IP address can't be updated by stopping the instance orchestration and restarting it. You would have to manually update the orchestration to assign a valid IP address to the vNIC attached to that IP network.<p>It is therefore recommended that if you update an IP network, you only expand the network by specifying the same IP address prefix but with a shorter prefix length. For example, you can expand 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.1.0/20. Don't, however, change the IP address.

The client credentials flow is used when the client itself owns the data and does not need delegated access from a resource owner, or when delegated access has been provided outside of the OAuth2 flow. This flow relies on the client to authenticate with the server, and the client's authentication credentials remain confidential.</p><p>This API supports the following authentication mechanisms:</p><ul><li>client_assertion: used by the client that asserts its identity using a <a href=""http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html"">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT). The JWT contains the signature that proves the possession of the private key.</li></ul><p>The OAuth2 scope attribute is required for all requests for access tokens. The server supports the following scopes:</p><ul><li>scope=oracle/iot/activation: used to obtain an access token for calling Activation REST APIs only</li><li>scope=empty scope, used to obtain an access token for calling all other REST APIs</li></ul><p>Any other scope value results in a BAD_REQUEST error.</p><h3>JSON Web Token (JWT)</h3><p> An open standard (<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519"">RFC 7519</a>) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with <strong>HMAC</strong> algorithm) or a public/private key pair using <strong>RSA</strong>.</p><p>JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (<code>.</code>), which are:</p><ul><li>Header</li><li>Payload</li><li>Signature</li></ul><p>Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.</p><p><code>xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</code> </p><h4>Header</h4><p>The header for authentication consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such as HmacSHA256 (""HS256"") or SHA256withRSA (""RS256"").</p><h4>Payload</h4><p>The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims about the Device Endpoint.</p><p><strong>Required claims</strong>: These are a set of required claims for authentication:<ul><li><strong>iss</strong> (issuer, should be the Device Activation ID for Activation purpose and Device Endpoint Id for Messaging purpose)</li><li><strong>exp</strong> (expiration time, the epoch value in seconds. If the expiration time is outside a 30 minute window, the request is rejected)</li><li><strong>aud</strong> (audience, should be ""oracle/iot/oauth2/token"").</li></ul><h4>Signature</h4><p>To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a key, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that in the following way:</p> <pre><code>Algorithm(base64UrlEncode(header) + &quot;.&quot; +base64UrlEncode(payload), key)</code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong> HmacSHA256 is only used in the activation procedure (scope=oracle/iot/activation), and the key used for the signature is the shared secret of the Device Endpoint. SHA256withRSA is used in other procedures (scope is empty), such as posting a message, and the secret key of the Device Endpoint is used as the key for signature.</p>"

Note that we now optionally support adding custom static HTTP headers as part of the integration configuration. </div> <div> ENTERPRISE Integrations can be used for bi-directional data/information flow between an IoT Application and the external applications. To establish inbound channel Integration's endpoint id and shared secret are used by an application to authenticate in the IoT Cloud Service and to get authorization to access the IoT REST APIs. Outbound connection is implemented through the Integration's message dispatching mechanism. If a message's sender belongs to an IoT Application and format field in payload refers to a format, registered on one of the DeviceModels that the Application supports, the message will be mapped to the IoT Application. If the Enterprise Integration under the Application is interested in the format of the message, wihch is indicated in the format list of its streams, the message will be dispatched to the URL of the integration. </div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Requirements:</strong></td> <td> Nothing specific </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Restrictions:</strong></td> <td> Stream level configuration is not supported </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Note:</strong></td> <td> Optional HTTP headers are set as a part of config (Integration level) with the key <code>httpHeaders</co>. </td> </tr> </table></div><h3>BICS Integration</h3><div> <table border=1> <tr> <td><strong>Description:</strong></td> <td> <div> A BICS integration is an integration that can be used to forward message data to Oracle's Business Intelligence Cloud Service. </div> <div> BICS Integrations can be used to turn message streams into table data transmitted to and consumed by the BI Cloud Service. </div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Requirements:</strong></td> <td> Each stream must have a stream-level config element of <code>tableName</code> which represents the name of the table to be created/populated on the BICS side. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Restrictions:</strong></td> <td> Each stream can have one and only one message format specified.

In this case IOT CS web UI should not be used for device and software management. By default this parameter is false.<li><b>partner/partnerName (STRING)</b> defines short name of the 3rd party platform. By default this parameter is empty.<li><b>partner/partnerDescription (STRING)</b> defines free form description of the 3rd party platform. By default this parameter is empty.<li><b>partner/partnerUrl (STRING)</b> defines URL of the 3rd party web console responsible for managing devices and software. <li><b>connectivity/inactiveTimeout (INTEGER)</b> defines length of a timeout period for an endpoint connectivity status value calculation. If an endpoint communicates with IoT server during this period it is being considered as ONLINE. In case when more than inactiveTimeout time has passed since the endpoint last communication, such endpoint is being considered as OFFLINE. The inactiveTimeout value is a number of seconds. This value is the same for all endpoints connected to the IoT server. Default value for this parameter is 3600.<li><b>security/allowedWildcardCertificateHostnames (STRING)</b> is a comma separated list of wildcarded hostnames. Only those wildcard certificate accepted whose host names exists in the list, plus .oraclecloud.com, plus .oraclecloudapps.com <li><b>cors/allowedOrigins (STRING)</b> is related to the CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) concept that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. In particular, allowedOrigins permits to list the domains from which resources of the Oracle IoT CS can be accessed through a browser. By default only the IoT CS domain is authorized otherwise. The list of allowed domains is very sensitive and needs to be managed with security concerns in mind.<li><b>ui/notificationTimeout (STRING)</b> specifies how long the successful command notifications should be displayed.<li><b>ui/dateAndTimeDisplay (STRING)</b> specifies the date and time format to use when displaying dates and times in the UI.<li><b>artifacts/uploadFileSizeMax (INTEGER)</b> specifies maximum size of the binary that can be uploaded. Default value is -1 i.e. unlimited size.<li><b>messaging/persistMessages (BOOLEAN)</b> defines whether messages processed by IoT server should be persisted in the storage. The persisted messages are accessible over REST API message queries. The messages to be persisted include but not limited to messages sent to IoT server from devices, messages sent by IoT server to devices, annotated messages dispatched over integrations. The default value is TRUE. The persisting can be disabled to improve IoT server throughput and to save storage space for data storing. When disabled no history of the processed messages is available, message queries are returning empty results.<li><b>messaging/messageTtlPeriod (INTEGER)</b> defines time-to-live (TTL) period in days for messages persisted on IoT server. Any message has been persisted for longer than the period is a subject for automatic deletion by the server. The time when the message is actually deleted is not guaranteed. The default TTL value is 90 days, the minimal value is 1 day. Also, the option can be set to -1 to never delete the persisted messages automatically. The storage space required to persist millions of message for long time can be huge, so a reasonable TTL period should be set to balance the need in messages accountability with the limitations of a storage space available for message data.</ul>"

To import an on-premises WebLogic Server domain configuration and its deployed applications into Oracle Java Cloud Service, you must create a service instance with the appropriate AppToCloud artifacts that are uploaded to an Oracle Storage Cloud Service container. Before you can create such a service instance, there are certain prerequisites that must be met, and certain on-premises tasks and Oracle Cloud tasks that must be performed. See <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-9873F59C-09B7-4F89-8FC6-B889056D2442' target='_blank'>About AppToCloud Prerequisites</a>,  <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-A713B016-7FBA-4272-8A6A-5E30892D0FC8' target='_blank'>AppToCloud Considerations and Limitations</a>, and <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=JSCUG-GUID-052B3FFD-E447-4D4E-B20A-F169BA2C45E4' target='_blank'>Typical Workflow for Migrating Applications to Oracle Java Cloud Service</a> in <i>Using Oracle Java Cloud Service</i>. After performing the required tasks, to associate the service instance with the AppToCloud artifacts when you create the instance, you must use <code>customPayload</code> in the request body and adhere to these conditions when creating:<ul><li>Must use the <code>PAAS</code> service level</li><li>Must use either the <code>12.2.1</code> or <code>12.1.3</code> version (even if your source domain is running a 11g version)</li><li>Must use either the <code>EE</code> or <code>SUITE</code> edition</li><li>Cannot currently add a Coherence data tier to a service instance that has AppToCloud</li><li>Must use an existing Oracle Storage Cloud Service container for the service instance backups.

If you specify an IP network, note that each underlying VM is auto-assigned a public and private IP address. See <a href='http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=STCSG-GUID-9A826000-2728-4837-905A-7835FA775F9B'>Creating an IP Network</a> in <i>Using Oracle Compute Cloud Service (IaaS)</i>.<p><b>IP reservations:</b> (Not available on Oracle Cloud Machine) A consequence of using an IP network is that the auto-assigned IP address could change each time the service instance is started. To assign fixed public IP addresses to a service instance that is attached to an IP network, you can first create reserved IP addresses, then provision the service instance to use those persistent IP addresses. See <a href='api-IP%20Reservations.html'>IP Reservations REST Endpoints</a> for information about how to find unused IP reservations and, if needed, create new IP reservations.<p><b>Exadata database and IP reservations:</b> (Not available on Oracle Cloud Machine) If you plan to use an Oracle Exadata database with an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance <i>in an account where regions are not supported</i>, see the My Oracle Support document titled <i>How to Request Authorized IPs for Provisioning a Java Cloud Service with Database Exadata Cloud Service</i> (MOS Note 2163568.1) to submit a request for IP reservations. You must obtain IP reservations for the Managed Servers you are going to provision before creating the service instance. The number of IP reservations you need corresponds to the number of Managed Server nodes you want to provision in the cluster.<p><b>Deprecation note:</b> The resource path <i>/paas/service/jcs/api/v1.1/instances/{identityDomainId}</i> will be deprecated in the future.

It is expected that targets of the latter form will usually occur as targets to which to push a message after an HTTP or HTTPS push has failed, but this is not required.</p>\n<p>Message push listeners will not follow HTTP redirects.

The content specifies a value for the header with name given by the content of the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element and value given by the content of the <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> element. Multiple <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> elements with the same <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> content are allowed; those after the first with a given name add headers rather than overwriting the earlier headers. The <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element's content may not begin with ""X-OC-"" (case-insensitive). The <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element's content must be a legal HTTP header name and the <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> element's content must be a legal HTTP header value.

If no <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> element is present, a message whose push fails is discarded. If present, <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> must contain 0 or more <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> elements. Each <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element specifies the kind of push failures to which it applies, and what to do in case of the given failure. If a push fails, the <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element that is first in document order that applies to the failure is used to determine what action is taken. If no <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element applies (in particular, if the <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> element contains no <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> elements), the message is discarded.</p>\n<p>A <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element must contain exactly one <code>&lt;cond&gt;</code>.

Note that, regardless of the values of <span class=""italic"">n</span> and <span class=""italic"">m</span>, the <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element will only apply if the response status is 300 or greater.

The content of the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element must be a non-negative integer, and is interpreted as a number of milliseconds to wait before attempts to push the message again. The allowed content of a <code>&lt;wait&gt;</code> element, other than <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, is the same as that of <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code>, except that <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> is not required. If there is no <code>&lt;target</code>&gt; element, it is equivalent to the <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> element being the same as that of the nearest enclosing <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;wait&gt;</code> element. After waiting the specified wait time, the listener then behaves as if it were a listener whose content is that of the <code>&lt;wait&gt;</code>; it attempts to push the message to the URI specified by its <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>, and, if that fails, applies the failure policy specified by its <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> child, if any. Note that the <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> of the parent is not inherited; successive push attempts use the <code>&lt;failurePolicy&gt;</code> at the appropriate level. Thus, a listener will never retry forever; if all push attempts for a given message fail, the message will eventually be discarded.</p>\n<p>If a message received by a listener is pushed to a queue or topic, the type and content of the message is preserved. All properties will also be preserved, with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">\n<li>\n<p>The <code>X_OC_PushCount</code> property will either be set to 1, if it is not present, is not an integer, or is a negative integer; otherwise, it will be incremented by 1. This property is used by listeners to track how many times the message has been re-sent to a queue or topic by a listener. If the incoming message's <code>X_OC_PushCount</code> is 8 or greater, and the listener is directed to push it to a queue or topic, it will instead cause a failure that can be handled by a <code>&lt;failure&gt;</code> element containing a <code>&lt;cond&gt;maxHops&lt;/cond&gt;</code> element.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ID of the received message is set as the <code>X_OC_PastJMSMessageID</code><span class=""italic""><code>N</code></span> property of the outgoing message, where <span class=""italic"">N</span> is 1 less than the value of the <code>X_OC_PushCount</code> property on the outgoing message.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The destination header of the received message, expressed as a String of the form <code>/queues/</code><span class=""italic""><code>queueName</code></span> or <code>/topics/</code><span class=""italic""><code>topicName</code></span>, is set as the <code>X_OC_PastJMSDestination</code><span class=""italic""><code>N</code></span> property of the outgoing message (<span class=""italic"">N</span> as above).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The value of the timestamp header of the received message is set as the <code>X_OC_PastJMSTimestamp</code><span class=""italic""><code>N</code></span> property of the outgoing message (<span class=""italic"">N</span> as above).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The value of the ""redelivered"" header of the received message is set as the <code>X_OC_PastJMSRedelivered</code><span class=""italic""><code>N</code></span> property of the outgoing message (<span class=""italic"">N</span> as above).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The correlation ID, reply-to, and delivery mode of the received message is set as the corresponding headers of the outgoing message.

The <span class=""italic""><code>type</code></span> parts of the two property headers might be, for example, <code>STRING</code> for <code>urgency</code> and <code>INT</code> for <code>count</code>.) The listener attempts to push messages it receives to <code>http://myHost/receiver</code> with method <code>PUT</code>, user and password <code>u</code> and <code>guest</code> respectively, and header <code>X-PIN: 123456</code>. If it cannot connect, it waits for 5 seconds and tries again. If that fails in any way, it immediately attempts to push to <code>http://myBackupHost/deadLetter</code>, with method <code>POST</code>, no HTTP authentication credentials, and no special headers. If the second push fails in any way, the message is discarded. If the initial push fails with response status code in the range 500-599, the listener will immediately attempt a push to <code>http://myBackupHost/deadLetter</code> as above. If that fails, the message is discarded. If the initial push fails with response status code in the range 401-499, the listener will immediately attempt a push to a queue with name <code>unpushed</code>. If that fails, the listener will attempt to push the message to a topic called <code>backup</code>, discarding the message if that fails. If the initial push failed for any other reason (for example, response code of exactly 400), the message is discarded.</p>\n<p>The following is an example with a durable subscription:</p>\n<pre dir=""ltr"">\n&lt;listener&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;myListener&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;target&gt;\n        &lt;uri&gt;http://myHost/receiver&lt;/uri&gt;\n        &lt;method&gt;PUT&lt;/method&gt;\n        &lt;user&gt;u&lt;/user&gt;\n        &lt;password&gt;guest&lt;/password&gt;\n        &lt;header&gt;\n            &lt;name&gt;X-PIN&lt;/name&gt;\n            &lt;value&gt;123456&lt;/value&gt;\n        &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n    &lt;subscription&gt;\n        &lt;clientId&gt;myListenerID&lt;/clientId&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;sub&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;/subscription&gt;\n    &lt;failurePolicy&gt;\n        &lt;failure&gt;\n            &lt;cond&gt;connection&lt;/cond&gt;\n            &lt;wait&gt;\n                &lt;time&gt;5000&lt;/time&gt;\n                &lt;failurePolicy&gt;\n                    &lt;failure&gt;\n                        &lt;cond&gt;any&lt;/cond&gt;\n                        &lt;wait&gt;\n                            &lt;time&gt;0&lt;/time&gt;\n                            &lt;target&gt;\n                                &lt;uri&gt;http://myBackupHost/deadLetter&lt;/uri&gt;\n                            &lt;/target&gt;\n                        &lt;/wait&gt;\n                    &lt;/failure&gt;\n                &lt;/failurePolicy&gt;\n            &lt;/wait&gt;\n        &lt;/failure&gt;\n        &lt;failure&gt;\n            &lt;cond&gt;responseCode:500-599&lt;/cond&gt;\n            &lt;wait&gt;\n                &lt;time&gt;0&lt;/time&gt;\n                &lt;target&gt;\n                    &lt;uri&gt;http://myBackupHost/deadLetter&lt;/uri&gt;\n                &lt;/target&gt;\n            &lt;/wait&gt;\n        &lt;/failure&gt;\n        &lt;failure&gt;\n            &lt;cond&gt;responseCode:401-499&lt;/cond&gt;\n            &lt;wait&gt;\n                &lt;time&gt;0&lt;/time&gt;\n                &lt;target&gt;\n                    &lt;uri&gt;urn:oracle:cloud:messaging:queues:unpushed&lt;/uri&gt;\n                &lt;/target&gt;\n                &lt;failurePolicy&gt;\n                    &lt;failure&gt;\n                        &lt;cond&gt;send&lt;/cond&gt;\n                        &lt;wait&gt;\n                            &lt;time&gt;0&lt;/time&gt;\n                            &lt;target&gt;\n                                &lt;uri&gt;urn:oracle:cloud:messaging:topics:backup&lt;/uri&gt;\n                            &lt;/target&gt;\n                        &lt;/wait&gt;\n                    &lt;/failure&gt;\n                &lt;/failurePolicy&gt;\n            &lt;/wait&gt;\n        &lt;/failure&gt;\n    &lt;/failurePolicy&gt;\n&lt;/listener&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>This listener is the same as the previous one, except that the topic it listens on and the selector, if any, are taken from an existing durable subscription with client ID <code>myListenerID</code> and name <code>sub</code>.</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n<h2 id=""CSMES-GUID-131C81BF-79EC-4CEA-9E4C-2DC5B4DE0A96"" class=""sect2"">Create a Message Push Listener</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The example shows an HTTP request and response for a message push listener named <code>l</code> being created.</p>\n<p>Request to create a listener named <code>l</code>.</p>\n<pre dir=""ltr"">\nPUT /MCSService03-MCSOracle3/api/v1/listeners/l HTTP/1.1\nX-OC-ID-TOKEN-STATUS: disabled\nAuthorization: Basic YXd1c2VyOldlbGNvbWVfMQ==\nContent-Type: application/xml\nAccept: application/json, application/xml;q=0.8, */*;q=0.5\nContent-Length: 286\n\n&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;\n&lt;listener&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;l&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;source&gt;\n        &lt;type&gt;topic&lt;/type&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;Incoming&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;/source&gt;\n    &lt;target&gt;\n        &lt;uri&gt;urn:oracle:cloud:messaging:queues:Preprocessing&lt;/uri&gt;\n    &lt;/target&gt;\n&lt;/listener&gt;\n</pre>\n<p><span class=""bold"">Note:</span></p>\n<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">\n<li>\n<p>The <code>X-OC-ID-TOKEN-STATUS</code> header indicates that the anti-CSRF token is disabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Authorization</code> header indicates that the authentication type is <code>Basic</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Accept</code> header accepts JSON (most preferable), or XML (second preference), or anything else (least preferable).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> header indicates that body of the request is in XML.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The XML body of the request indicates the properties of the listener.
